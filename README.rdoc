Budget Mode is a platform to help improve financial literacy. People can sign up to learn about or teach financial-related topics. Given the nature of the web app, I created nested routes so that each course has a section and each section has a lesson. While courses may be free of charge, users have the option of charging a fee using Stripe. For this app, I also used JavaScript, JQuery, AJAX, and JSON to give teachers within the web app the ability to drag and re-order lessons successfully.
